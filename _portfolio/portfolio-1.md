Solution:
Implementing a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based attendance system offers a secure, efficient, and accurate solution. Each individual's RFID-tagged ID card uniquely identifies them, enabling quick attendance capture by simply placing the card on a reader. Real-time clock functionality ensures precise time records, and data can be stored in a database, accessible through RS232 or USB connections, or viewed via HyperTerminal software, streamlining attendance management for schools, colleges, universities, and workplaces.
