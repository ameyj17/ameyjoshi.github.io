**objectives:**
**1. Development of AI-based Image processing and object detection models from drone imagery using multimodal fusion.**

**2. Development of ensemble-based techniques for identification of objects from drone imagery to handle the issue of multi-scale resolution of images
(e.g. small scale such as human faces, pets, etc. to large scale such as hills, airports, regions, terrains, etc.)**

**3. Development of explainability methods for human interpretable explanations of the models developed in 1 and 2 and relaying the information
to the ground station in an effective manner.**
